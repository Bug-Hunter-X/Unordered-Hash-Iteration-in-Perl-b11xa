This repository demonstrates an uncommon Perl bug related to the unordered iteration of hashes.  The bug.pl file shows code that iterates through a hash, expecting a specific order.  However, Perl's hash iteration is not guaranteed to maintain insertion order, leading to unpredictable results. The bugSolution.pl file provides a solution demonstrating how to maintain insertion order if needed.
